# EasyInterventionModels for Dolibarr ERP CRM
This Dolibarr module allows you to add intervention line models. The module adds a dropdown list of all available models to the intervention line, as well as an "Apply" button to apply the selected model to the current intervention line. The module comes with two default models: "Classic" which allows the addition of extra fields, and "Personal" which provides a text with predefined fields.
